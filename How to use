You should open your cmd and install:

pip install windows-curses
pip install random2(maybe)

Then you could either open the cmd, put on full screen, and write the file's directory , and execute SnakeGame_by_SalaheddineMorchid.py if you want to play full screen
or you could simply execute SnakeGame_by_SalaheddineMorchid.py from the directory
